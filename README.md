## Homework 4

In this assignment, you will leverage your knowledge of TypeScript and React to build a simple e-commerce storefront.

## Assignment

The db.json file contains a list of 30 products. Your task is to simply render the products in a flexbox container. Each product should be rendered as a card with the following properties:

### Requirements

- Each product card should have the same height and width
- The description should be truncated to 100 characters (with an ellipsis if it's too long)
- The design should be responsive and should look good on mobile devices
- The tags should be displayed as separate pills on the card
- Each tag should have a different color, but the color should be consistent across all cards
- Styling should be done with TailwindCSS as much as possible
- The application should be deployed using GitHub Pages
